        Walking is a low-impact exercise that can be easily incorporated into
        daily routines. Aim for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking most days
        of the week. If needed, start with shorter durations and gradually
        increase your walking time.

        Engaging in strength training exercises helps maintain muscle mass,
        improve bone density, and support joint health. You can use resistance
        bands, free weights, or weight machines to perform exercises such as
        squats, lunges, bicep curls, and shoulder presses. Start with lighter
        weights and gradually increase the resistance as you become more
        comfortable.

      <li className="exercise-paragraph">
        Incorporate exercises that challenge and improve balance, reducing the
        risk of falls. Simple activities like standing on one leg, heel-to-toe
        walking, or using a balance board can be beneficial. However, ensure you
        have appropriate support or supervision when attempting balance
        exercises.
